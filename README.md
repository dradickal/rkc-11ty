Source code for radickalcreations.com, a portfolio site for myself, David Radick.

## Development
The site pages are built using the Eleventy static site generator. The code is based on the template [Fernfolio](https://jamstackthemes.dev/theme/fernfolio/) by Tyler M. Roderick. I modified the template to decouple a handful of Netlify integrations,  replace the CommonJS module approach with ESM  and other functionality updates due to library changes.
